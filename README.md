The assignment is split into 3 major parts:

Detect the boxes from a greater distance
Detect the box colours
Detect the boundary

I think the easiest code to get started with right now would be trying to get the robot to stay within its line boundary.
The code I have uploaded right now is from the SunFounder website, which tells the robot to follow the line.
We want ours to move away from it.
